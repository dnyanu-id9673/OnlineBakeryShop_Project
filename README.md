Online Bakery Shop
The online bakery shop project aims to create a virtual platform where customers can browse, select, and purchase various bakery products from the comfort of their own homes. Here's a detailed description of the project:
1.	Homepage: The homepage serves as the gateway to the online bakery shop. It typically includes an attractive layout showcasing featured products, special promotions, and new arrivals. Users can navigate through different categories such as bread, cakes, pastries, cookies, etc.
2.	Product Pages: Each product has its own dedicated page with detailed descriptions, images, pricing, and options for customization (if applicable). Customers can add items to their shopping cart directly from these pages.
3.	Shopping Cart: A virtual shopping cart allows customers to review their selected items, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout. It also displays the total cost, including taxes and any applicable shipping fees.
4.	User Accounts: Customers can create accounts to save their shipping addresses, payment methods, and order history. This feature streamlines the checkout process for returning customers and provides them with a personalized experience.
5.	Order Management System: An admin panel allows bakery staff to manage orders efficiently. They can view new orders, update order statuses (e.g., processing, shipped, delivered), and communicate with customers regarding their orders.
6.	Inventory Management: The system should keep track of available stock levels for each product and automatically update inventory counts when orders are placed. This helps prevent overselling and ensures that customers are informed about product availability.
7.	Reviews and Ratings: Customers should have the option to leave reviews and ratings for products they've purchased. This feature helps build trust and credibility for the bakery shop while providing valuable feedback for future customers.
